# HEAT
## Description:
The Heat flux Engineering Analysis Toolkit (HEAT) is a suite of tools for predicting the heat flux
incident upon PFCs in tokamaks, and the associated PFC state (ie temperature).  
The toolkit connects CAD, FVM, MHD, ray tracing, plasma physics, and more, in one streamlined package.  
The objective is to enable engineers and physicists to quickly ascertain heat loads given specific magnetic
configurations and geometric configurations.  HEAT has been used to design the SPARC PFCs and will continue to be developed for control room use as SPARC begins operations.

Some examples of what HEAT can predict:
 - 3D heat loads from 2D and 3D plasmas for limited and diverted discharges
 - Heat fluxes from the optical approximation, ion gyro orbit approximation, and photon flux
 - Heat and particle fluxes from filaments and runaway electrons
 - 3D heat flux profiles from RMPs and Error Fields
 - Time varying heat loads and temperature profiles
 - Magnetic field line traces
 - Many other quantities
---
The latest release of HEAT is v4.2, which includes the following notable additions / patches:
 - Mitsuba3 for photon tracing
 - Ability to read STLs directly instead of STEPs (Bring Your Own Mesh)
 - A Runaway Electron module developed by A Feyrer (MIT)
 - Ability to read arbitrary R,Z,qPar profiles from a CSV developed by E Tinacba (ORNL)

For users who want to run HEAT, you will need to download the HEAT docker container from dockerhub.  The HEAT docker container has been tested on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.  See the tutorials link below for more information on installation.

Dockerhub repo:  https://hub.docker.com/r/plasmapotential/heat

There is a companion repo to this one, which provides some HEAT pre/post processing functions:

## Contributing

As an open-source software, HEAT is extremely open to contributions. You have many ways to contribute:
1. Discussion (asking for use cases or features)
2. Documentation (add clearest examples or fill non-documented code sections)
3. Code (Add new features or enhance the existing ones)
4. Issues (Help another to achieve the expected use of HEAT or report any problem, bug or misoperation that you can note)
